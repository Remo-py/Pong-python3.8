# Pong-Game-python3

This is just a game I made in python for fun. It's simple pong!

This game runs in python 3.8, I have had issues with older versions.

This is a really good beginner project, if you would like to learn python.

It's also just a fun game to play in your freetime.

There will be a linux executable for all the linux users out there like me!
